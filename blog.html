                <h2>Worship</h2>
                <p>A Prayer for Reflection before Worship
                    Eternal God, we confess that we live very individual lives.
                    We want to follow our own paths in life.
                    We want to make it on our own.
                    We want to find our own happiness.
                    We want to live by our own rules.
                    O Lord, even in our faith, we tend to think in very individual terms.
                    We talk about a personal relationship with you as if it is just about
                    “you and me.”
                    We are tempted to think that faith is what we do in church on Sunday mornings.
                    Yet you show us a different way.
                    For in your word you teach us ethics.
                    You show us what it means to live in a community of faith.
                    You call us to care for the poor and those in need.
                    You remind us again and again that a living faith includes faithful
                    actions and deeds.
                    Help us to live in this world in joyful obedience to you,
                    out of gratitude for all that you have done for us,
                    in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
                <br>
                <p>Call to Worship (based on James 4:8, 10)
                    Draw near to God,
                    and God will draw near to you.
                    Humble yourselves before the Lord,
                    and God will exalt you.
                    O Lord, help us through our worship
                    to draw closer to you.
                    Help us to be humble
                    and to seek your way.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Words of Greeting
                        We welcome you to this time of worship in the name of our glorious
                        Lord Jesus Christ, who draws us, through his Body, the Church, into
                        friendship with God and with one another. In this time of worship,
                        let us still our minds and claim the divine promise: “Be still, and
                        know that I am God! I am exalted among the nations, I am exalted in
                        the earth” (Psalm 46:10). </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Call to Confession
                        The letter of James promises, “Blessed is anyone who endures temptation” (1:12). Yet we know that too often we give in to temptation
                        and do what is wrong. Let us confess our sins together before God.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Unison Prayer of Confession
                            O God, we want to have our cake and eat it, too:
                            we want to be a friend of the world and still be your friend.
                            Yet, Jesus taught us: “No one can serve two masters.”
                            Give us strength and courage to get our priorities straight:
                            help us to seek your kingdom first.
                            Help us to live faithfully and joyfully in the world,
                            and to be friends with the people you call us to serve.
                            Help us also to remember that our best relationship
                            is the one we have with you,
                            We pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Assurance of Forgiveness
                                “The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy” (James 3:17). In Jesus Christ, we are forgiven, and
                                we are given a new way to live. Let us accept God’s grace, and live
                                new lives of faith, obedience, and joy.</p>
